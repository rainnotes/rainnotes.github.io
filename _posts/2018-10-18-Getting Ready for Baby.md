We are getting ready for baby and I figured it was time to put some stuff together, mostly as a reminder for ourselves and possibly a place to look back and see what was write and what was wrong. 
I stumbled across this post on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/289pqp/what_infantchild_psychological_development_books/) that I think has all the info that will be the core of what I want to be/do as a parent and what I assume Joanna will also want to be. 

* Actively playing with your child, with no agenda, is the best way to increase cognitive development.

* Limit digital media (TV, tablets, movies)

* Read together

* Happy family, happy child. Eat dinner together, don't argue in front of your children (if possible, and let them see you apologize and amend if you do).

* Treat your spouse/partner how you wish your children to value someone to treat them in a future relationship.

* Value effort over accomplishments. Children who were praised for achievement performed worse than those praised for effort.

* All children progress at their own rate, don't compare your children to others.

* Empathize with your children and treat them with respect.


On a side note I'm already pretty sure I think my kid is the cutest one out there...never thought I would be one of those parents who believes it. 

2022 Update as I import this post: Yes my kids are the cutest ones. Its also crazy how much perspective changes. I think all the things I mentioned above are still true but I don't think its as black and white as above. The truth is someone you just do the best you can and I think as long as you are trying to be the best you can you will raise some good kids.
