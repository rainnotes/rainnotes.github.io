Here I go, I want to journey into actually writing consistently. As always who knows how it goes, but as my partner says "just manifest it" so here is my attempt at manifesting. 

The goal with this site is to provide myself with a spot where I can type freely and express myself. A sort of journal, notebook, brain dump that I can look back on. I think expressing my feelings on paper (albeit digital paper) is going to help me gain some clarity.

I have been working through some books and trying to figure out my life a bit, I hope writing things down will help clear my brain a bit.
