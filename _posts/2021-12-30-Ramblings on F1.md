So like many people I have been getting into Formula 1 mostly because of [Drive to Survive on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890). The netflix show is really awesome and shows you how amazing this sport is (or as my wife says its not a real sport).

I have always been into racing of some form but I have never really followed along. I spent time in my youth watching Nascar and attending races. It was always awesome, if for nothing else than the sound of those cars. F1 gives me the same draw but I find it even more fascinating. From what I gather on the internet many people don't like the team aspect or the part of the sport that involves more than just the drivers. I love that each team does not have the same car rather something that is similar across the board but its really up to the team to get the most out of it and product a car that is better than the others. That paired with the skill of the drivers creates a lot of variables for variation in the sport. 

While I have loved the sport so far its easy to say that knowing I started with one of the most exiting seasons in many years. As much as I want to see Lewis Hamilton win his 8, seeing Max get his first was pretty awesome. I am pumped to keep following it and hopefully stay away from the toxic community of F1 fans that I have seen online. 

Also excited to see what VB can do on other team, he is secretly on of my faves.
