I'm not going to say I've been getting deep into house music but I will say I have been listening to it A LOT. Almost anything I can get my hands on. It really just makes me happy. Its been one of the two big changes I've made over the past couple of weeks to make myself productive. The second change being to wear shoes during the work day.

House music and like makes me far happier than shoes, but I think the shoes are working. 

There is just something about putting some headphones on and just jamming out to it. 

Its pretty basic but here is a really fun Apple Music playlist.
