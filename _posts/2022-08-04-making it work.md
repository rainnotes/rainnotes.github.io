I always make these type of posts...I'm trying to move past that. I want to jounral often but I can seem to get myself to do it. What do I even talk about? I read some tips that re-reading what you write and addressing the topics to your future self help to keep you going. I'm not sure how to make that not seem awkward. I want this to feel natural but maybe I just forget about everyone else and just go for it? 

The above sounds like ramblings of a crazy person but oh well. 

Going to leave it here. Maybe I'll juts pick something I thought about that day and write it up. I need less pressure on myself to make this work.
