I've been struggling with finding a book that keeps my attention. I have such a bad habit of not finishing books that I start even if I get really far into them. I don't like doing that but I also think its justifiable. If I want to not finish the book, is it really worth my time? but that is a another discussion. 

I sound like a child but nothing has held me like the Harry Potter series. The character development and mystery theme kept me reading and wanting more through every book. How do I replicate that? It feels like most books I pick up are just meh. 

I reached out to some friends and my partner, both recommended that I get into Brandon Sanderson. With the recommendation being to start at Mistborn. I am a little apprehensive going in, I have never read fantasy and I just can't see it being my thing. I've never enjoyed fantasy movies but the more I think about it, I think its the visuals not necessarily the story. I hate crappy CGI and every fantasy type movie I've ever seen is filled with it. Now the thinking might be since a book has no visuals I might enjoy it. I don't have a reason not to like fantasy but I'm just apprehensive.

I mean just look at the cover, it doesn't hook me. I just cringe but I think that's me being far too judgmental. 


I'm going to give it a serious shot. I've started it and am enjoying it already but just struggling to get a grasp of all the new words and names in the world he has built. I'm sure that will go away overtime. Minus the fact that I sound a bit pretentious and snooty at reading fantasy with cringe-y graphics, I am excited and keeping an open mind. I am hoping this is the answer to my reading slump.
