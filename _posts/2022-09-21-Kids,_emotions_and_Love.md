I spent a hard morning with my oldest son. Like all three year olds he has some crazy emotions. He is honestly one of the best kids I have ever come across in my life. I am so lucky to be his dad. He is kind, gentle, reserved, smart and curious. This doesn't make these emotion filled days any easier. 

It all started with not putting enough almond milk in his cereal (what enough is, I have no idea). Just a struggle from the start of the AM. This lead into a long 30 minute tantrum in getting his close on. To the point where I had to get his clothes on myself. I spent much of that 30 minutes hugging him and telling him I love him. 

Its hard, its so hard, not to question yourself as a parent every step of the way. "Am I doing the right thing? ", "is this the right thing?", "Is this going to make the problem worse?", "is giving him lots of hugs just delaying this?", " do I need to set my emotions aside an just give him LOTS of love?". I always leave these situations feeling like I didn't do the right thing and guilty for not hugging him enough. Its easy to get annoyed in these situations but I want to make sure I am the best dad possible for these kids. I love them so much, and I only want what is right. I don't think there is ever too much love you can show to your kids, I want to make sure I don't let my frustrations get in the way of that.
