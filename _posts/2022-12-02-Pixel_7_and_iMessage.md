I've spend lots of my life between Iphone, Android, Windows Phone and even Blackberry. For most of that time I have never been in love with ios. But it does seem to be that anytime I use an Iphone I keep that device for the longest amount of time. I think the reason is ecosystem. 

I just recently switched to the Pixel 7 from an Iphone 13 pro max and I quite like it. I love the current version of android very much. With that said I am already getting the green bubble hate in the family as none of the photos and worse videos arrive looking horrible. I know this isn't googles fault but everyone else believes it is googles fault. If feels like a better solution if apple would break up the imessage group and let imessage functionality work with those who have an iphone and send the crap to those with and android device. That way the negative affects only those on android and not the whole group. 

Its just annoying and making me consider getting an iphone again...I mean that is exactly what apple wants.
