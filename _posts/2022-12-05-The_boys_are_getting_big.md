Man does time fly. My oldest is about to be 4, while he acts like a 40 year old its still hard for me to believe how fast time flies with them. The past 4 years has without a doubt been the longest and shortest 4 ever. I remember looking at 4 years and thinking it was an eternity, now my kids have shown me that 4 years is nothing. 4 years is but a mere drop in the bucket in this life. It feels more important than ever to enjoy the time we have and maximize how good of a parent I can be. 

I love them both so much that its hard to imagine a time without them. A clich√© yes, but its so true. I just hope I am doing a good enough job being a good Dad. Its not easy, making them happy while keeping my own sanity is crazy hard. 

Happy birthday bud. I can wait for H to get this big. I love you both
