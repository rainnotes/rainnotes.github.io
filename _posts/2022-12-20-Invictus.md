# Invictus by William Ernest Henley

Out of the night that covers me,

black as the pit from pole to pole

I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul



in the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced not cried aloud. 

**Under the bludgeonings of chance**

**my head is bloody, but unbowed**



Beyond this place of wrath and tears

Looms but the horror of the shade

and yet the menace of the years

finds and shall fine me - unafraid



It matters not how straight that gate

how charged with punishment the scroll

I am the master of my fate

I am the captain of my soul.
