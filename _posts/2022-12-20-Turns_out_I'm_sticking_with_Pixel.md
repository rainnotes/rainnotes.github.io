I was really unsure of if I wanted to stick with my Pixel. The one thing I did know was that I wanted a chance. My iPhone was boring me, a true first world problem. I took a leap and bought a Pixel for $499. First thing first, you cannot beat that price. Its half the cost at least of a iPhone 14 pro, a phone I would consider equivalent to the pixel. That alone was a huge factor. Google has so many things right with this. The biggest issue I had was lock in. If iMessage was on android, it would have been a no brainer. It's clear why apple doesn't want to give this up. Thankfully most of my family is willing to use whatsapp but that still isn't a seamless experience, people in the US don't have the reflexes built to use it whenever they communicate. 

Oh well the $500 savings is hard to beat. I am really enjoying it and could see my self sticking with a pixel now that I've broken free from the lock in.
