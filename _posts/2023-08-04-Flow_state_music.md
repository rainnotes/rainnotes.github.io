I write this as I am incredibly distracted by this music I've been running across. I've written about this in the past but, this is by no means a crazy revelation, house music has been incredible for helping me stay in a flow state. I can feel my self checking off tasks to the beat. Makes working just that much better

Going to drop some videos in here, as I find them, that just put me in that flow state.
