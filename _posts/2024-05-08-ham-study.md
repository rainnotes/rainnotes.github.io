Just got my Baofeng and my Tech license in hand. Got both without a clue in the world what I was doing. Still have no idea. I studied the questions and passed the test. I’m a little peeved I didn’t study for General and Extra but not a big deal to do that later. 

I’m now at the point where I have enough to get started but don’t know how to get started. I’ve turned the radio on can’t find any signals worthwhile. I guess it’s all a sign that I need to step back and actually figure out what I’m doing. Just feel like there should be some better clearer actions on how to go about all this.
